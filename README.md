### Hi there, I'm Sunya ðŸ‘‹

I'm a tech enthusiast who loves diving into home projects.
Over the years, I've accumulated a lot of code, and while it might not all be worth sharing, I've decided to create this new account to better organize my work. My goal is to build a repository with cleaner, more structured code, and I'm focusing on:
## * Organized Commits: 
Using a clear and logical commit history.
## * Better Pipelines: 
Creating streamlined and efficient workflows.
 ## * Synchronized Documentation: 
Aligning my documentation with my Jira stories for better project tracking.

Feel free to explore my repositories. I'm excited to share my journey as I build a more organized and documented collection of my work.
